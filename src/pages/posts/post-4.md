# Creating a Blog with Markdown Posts

Finally, I learned how to add content using Markdown files. Each post has metadata like title, author, description, tags, and images.

### What I Learned

- Using `import.meta.glob()` to fetch all Markdown posts dynamically.
- Creating layouts for consistent page design.
- Displaying posts with titles, images, and tags on the blog page.

This setup makes it easy to add new posts and keep my blog organized.
