# Starting My Astro Journey

Today, I started learning Astro, a modern framework for building websites. I set up my development environment, installed Astro, and created my first project.

## Key Accomplishments

- Installed Astro and created a new project.
- Learned how to use `.astro` files for building pages.
- Built a basic homepage with HTML, CSS, and components.

Iâ€™m excited to continue learning and share my progress here!
