# Creating Reusable Components

After setting up my first Astro project, I learned how to create reusable components. Components help me keep my code organized and maintainable.

### What I Built

- Header and Footer components
- Navigation and Social links components
- Greeting component with interactive buttons

This experience taught me the power of component-based design in modern web development.
