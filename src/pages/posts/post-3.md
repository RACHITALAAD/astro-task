# Styling and Theming in Astro

Next, I focused on styling my website and implementing a dark mode toggle. Astro makes it simple to include both global CSS and scoped component styles.

### Highlights

- Added custom styles for header, navigation, and footer.
- Implemented dark and light themes using `localStorage` and JavaScript.
- Learned to apply component-scoped CSS for maintainable design.

Dark mode was tricky at first, but it now works perfectly across all pages!
